## MPU6050 sensor

 Read values from a MPU6050 accelerometer and dump them to the serial port.

The code

```python

```

## Example calculations

The BMP180 hardware contains a dozen calibration coefficients which must be read and stored before acquiring data.
We have avoided this step to avoid complicating the program, and have instead provided sample values for the
temperature measurement process.

```bash
```

Sample calculation for raw values 116(MSB), 196(LSB) .
