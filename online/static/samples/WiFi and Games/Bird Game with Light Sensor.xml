## Bird game 

addGame: Create a game
set bird altitude; The height of the bird from the floor of the game box is set to the input number. It should be between 0(floor), and 1000(Roof)


Your phone has a built in light sensor.

The readings of the sensor increase with intensity of light falling on the light sensor which is usually located next to the front camera.

These readings are measured and used to set the height of the character in the game.

 Stand under a tubelight and move the phone close and away from the light to observe how the bird moves along with it.
